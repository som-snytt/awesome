  //
  // One way declared types in Java differ from one another is whether the type is a class (which
  // includes enums) or an interface (which includes annotation types). An independent property of a
  // type is its relation to the surrounding lexical context. A top level class does not appear
  // inside another class or interface. If a type is not top level it is nested. However, there are
  // a number of distinct ways a type can be nested. First, a type can be a member of another type;
  // a member type is directly enclosed by another type declaration. All member types have names;
  // however, some member types are inner classes and others are not. If a type is explicitly or
  // implicitly static, it is not an inner class; all member interfaces are implicitly static.
  // 
  // Inner classes also include local classes, which are named classes declared inside of a block
  // like a method or constructor body, and anonymous classes, which are unnamed classes whose
  // instances are created in expressions and statements. Anonymous classes are used to implement
  // specialized enum constants. Inner classes have access to instance variables of any lexically
  // enclosing instance; that is, the fields of the object an inner class is created in reference
  // to. However, not all inner classes have enclosing instances; inner classes in static contexts,
  // like an anonymous class used in a static initializer block, do not.
